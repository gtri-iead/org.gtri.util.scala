Goals:
#1: Add working tests
#2: XsdElementUtil.parser function should be converted to PartialParser that takes an element stack for parsing qNames
#3: Convert XsdElementUtil.parser functions to generically parse N attributes
#3a: How to connect to attribute values?
#3aa: Best that could be generically parsed would be a Map[XsdQName,Any] but would still require "parsing" by constructor to assign to specific fields
#3ab: Also doesn't allow per type recovery defaults - a name
#4: Convert XsdElement.toAttribute to generically build attribute list
