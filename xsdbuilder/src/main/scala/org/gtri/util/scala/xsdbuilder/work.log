Goals:
#1: Add working tests
#2: XsdElementUtil.parser function should be converted to PartialParser that takes an element stack for parsing qNames
#3: Convert XsdElementUtil.parser functions to generically parse N attributes
#3a: How to connect to attribute values?
#3aa: Best that could be generically parsed would be a Map[XsdQName,Any] but would still require "parsing" by constructor to assign to specific fields
#3ab: Also doesn't allow per type recovery defaults - a name
#4: Convert XsdElement.toAttribute to generically build attribute list

Mar 3

#1: TODO: split XML conversion methods (toXmlElement, parser) away from element definitions to promote the reuse of elements definitions in contexts other than just XML parsing/generation
#2: TODO: better error message for unbound prefix
#3: TODO: better validation on child elements maybe using regex on qnames? maybe a model group validator?
#3a: Currently, there is no validation error if a child element is required but missing
#4: TODO: support for any XML content within appinfo

Mar 4

#1: TODO: Change toXmlElement to genXmlElement and change return type to Parser[XsdXXX,XmlElement] - toXmlElement could fail with no bound prefix for a qname (fixable)
